## Hi, my name is Guilherme but you can call me Guiga

I'm a Brazilian Structural Engineer who is currently moving into the software development world.

I love programming and am currently enrolled in a Software Engineering MBA program at [USP/Esalq](https://mbauspesalq.com/cursos/mba-em-engenharia-de-software)

I hope you like my profile :).
